STABILITY OF CONSERVATIVE SYSTEMS
The mass point moves over the smooth surface of a torus given by the parametric equations 
x = ρcosψ, y = ρsinψ, z = bsinψ, ρ = a + b cos θ,
where the z-axis is pointing upward. Find the possible motions of the point when the angle θ is a constant, and analyze the stability of these motions.
